= Introduction =

= Analyzable areas for improvements - video lag issue =

  * CPU specific optimized compilation (v5, v6,v6vfp, v7, neon, x86)
  * direct calling of opengl without sdl for video, audio
  * use arm assembly code for copying pixels between arrays
  * use arm assembly code for yuv 2 rgb
  * use inbuilt decoder for known file formats (avi)
  * use hardware acceleration
  * set higher priority process, thread for the application
  * read the file contents and keep in memory as much as possible (queue size)
  * skip bidrectional frames 
  * set optimized settings in FFmpeg
  * 16bit or 24bit rendering based on lag condition
