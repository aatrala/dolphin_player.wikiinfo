= Possible areas for improvement - video lag issue =

  * CPU specific optimized compilation (v5, v6,v6vfp, v7, neon, x86) at ndk various libraries
  * direct calling of opengl without going through sdl for video, audio
  * use arm assembly code for copying pixels between arrays
  * use arm assembly code for yuv 2 rgb
  * use inbuilt decoder for known file formats (avi)
  * use hardware acceleration
  * set higher priority process, thread for the application
  * read the file contents and keep in memory as much as possible (queue size)
  * skip bidrectional frames 
  * set optimized settings in FFmpeg for faster decoding
  * 16bit or 24bit rendering based on video lag condition
  * Profiling the code for identifying places using most cpu time
  * no debug print statements in release build and during video playtime - consumes time

= Known questions without answers =

  * what to do if the decoding of a frame itself is >40ms, for a frame rate of 25FPS ?
