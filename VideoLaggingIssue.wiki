= Possible areas for improvement - video lag issue =

==Tasks finished==
  * CPU specific optimized compilation (v5, v6,v6vfp, v7, neon, x86) at ndk various libraries -doable
  * Profiling the code for identifying places using most cpu time - done 
  * no debug print statements in release build and during video playtime - consumes time -done
  * set higher priority process, thread for the application -doable
  * Remove debugging symbols and any profiling related code in release build
  * skip frames algorithm - even after optimization, time taken to decode and show a frame to screen is greater than the time required to put the frame on screen 
  * read the file contents and keep in memory as much as possible (queue size) - done
  * use arm assembly code for yuv 2 rgb -code available
  * set optimized settings in FFmpeg for faster decoding - code available
 
==Doable==
  * direct calling of opengl without going through sdl for video, audio 
  * use arm assembly code for copying pixels between arrays
  * skip bidrectional frames -code available
  * 16bit or 24bit rendering based on video lag condition
  * multi threaded single frame decoding
  * multi threaded - parallel frames decoding -ffmpeg
  * Time slicing by OS for each thread(Read packets, Decode Video, Audio Thread, Put Frames to Screen thread) needs to be verified.(Whether they are given equal time slices, concurrently)
  * Process specific optimization during compilation
  * Java overhead for layout, display
  * Using surface flinger in native ??

==Details required==
  * use inbuilt decoder for known file formats (avi)
  * use hardware acceleration - not available
  * using gstreamer framework ??
  * using libstagefright

= Known questions and possible answers =
  * what to do if the decoding of a frame itself is >40ms, for a frame rate of 25FPS ?  skip frames, disable audio, convert the file to a supported native file format with less FPS ??
